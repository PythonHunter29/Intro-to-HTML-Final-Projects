                <h3>Europe Trip</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2022 I took a group trip to Europe where I saw some of the most historically important places in the multiple countries we visited. We went to Britain, France, Belgium, and Germany. The weather was extremely pleasant throughout the little more 
                    than a week the trip lasted. I took a train and ferry ride for the first time in my life during it.

                <h3>Solar Eclipse</h3>
                <p>
                    When the path of the solar eclipse went over Indiana in 2024 I took a trip to witness it along the path of the totality. It was an awesome experience and because of the spot I was in, I was able to view it without special solar glasses because the 
                    moon covered so much of the sun's light. I got to see areas that I hadn't been before since I camped for two nights leading up to the event.
