            <h3>Gateway Community and Technical College</h3>
            <p>
                I was dual enrolled then fully enrolled when in high school through Gateway. I took a half day of automotive classes for two years. My senior year I would switch campus locations in the middle of the school day but both were taught through Gateway. 
                I built up a large amount of college credits by doing this that enabled me to graduate my later University earlier than most people who started at the same time as me.

            <h3>Northern Kentucky University</h3>
            <p>
                I attended Northern Kentucky University for half a day while in high school. Doing that helped me build up credit hours for my later University. After I graduated Purdue I started going back to NKU to pursue another degree that aligned better 
                with the job that I got after obtaining my Bachelor's degree.

            <h3>Purdue University</h3>
            <p>
                This was where I did my undergrad degree at. I spent four years studying to obtain a Robotics Degree. I lived both on campus and a few minutes away, all year long, including the summers save for a vacation here and there.
