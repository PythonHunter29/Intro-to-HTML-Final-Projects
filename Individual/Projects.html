                Part of my interest lies in lending my opinion to local governments when new parks, public spaces, and/or renewal projects come up. I take the time when scrolling through social media to share my opinion when surveys for local input appears. 
                The same thing goes when surveys for local issues appear too. Most of the time, which most people can relate to, when I am scrolling I'm not actually doing anything productive or exciting and so by doing those small actions 
                I do feel a sense of accomplishment and purpose from completing them.

            <p class="text">
                One thing that I check multiple times a week are the local events that are taking place. I have found that there is so much to do in my local area that I almost always am missing out on something, there's so much happening that I have to decide 
                what looks more interesting. I've gone to park clean ups, discount days at new restaurants, and popup flea markets.

            <p class="text">
                When at home I like to make crafts for my pets. I am good at creating new faux rock hides for my pet leopard geckos. I have made many over the near ten years that they've been my pets. I've gotten very good at making them appear like real 
                rocks and withstanding wear and tear. I have even sold the craft hides because the level of quality I've achieved through trial and error.
