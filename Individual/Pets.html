            <h3>Dog</h3>
            <p>
                My best companion is my older dog "Baby" who is a Shi Tzu. She is very spoiled but she loves to snuggle. She get pretty demanding when she knows it's about dinner time or when she hasn't gotten a treat after going outside. She loves to go on car rides, 
                but she'll pout a long time when she's in her carrier instead of the front seat with me. She doesn't shed which is nice but it means she has to get haircuts which have yet to get done in a single day because she's so dramatic about them.

            <h3>Cat</h3>
            <p>
                My next best companion is my cat "Phantom". He is not nearly as big a fan of laying down with people but if he does it's on his terms. He always wants food too but he never eats it when you give it to him, rather he just sniffs it. He makes up for "Baby" not 
                shedding by leavings black hair everywhere.

            <h3>Lizards</h3>
            <p>
                I have two Leopard Geckos that just hang out. One of them likes to look out the glass and see what you're doing. The other hides all day until it is night which is when she'll start being active. They like mealworms, crickets, cockroaches, and silkworms.
